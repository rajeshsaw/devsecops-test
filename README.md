It always fascinates me to see how the application development lifecycle aka SDLC has evolved rapidly in recent years from a traditional WaterFall to CI-CD framework to adapt major technology shifts like Cloud, Edge computing, AI, ML, Cloud Native technologies & mobility.

Few of the Cloud-Native techs like Docker, Containers, Kubernetes have been widely embraced across the industries & have become incredibly popular among both the technology & business world.

But at the same time being part of a widely spread open-source community, these techs are constantly evolving & expanding. 
For instance, Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) an open-source software foundation dedicated to making cloud-native computing universal and sustainable runs nearly 120+ projects (16 graduated, 26 incubating, and 78 sandbox projects ) in the areas like Security & Compliance, networking, DB & others.

That's why being a tech enthusiast, I have decided to learn & experience a few popular Open-source projects around Kubernetes every week & share my personal viewpoint on them.

Keep learning ðŸ“š and keep growing ðŸ“ˆ
